What is K8up?
-------------

On APPUiO we've made backing up your data simple. All you need to do is
create a backup ``Schedule`` object in your APPUiO namespace. This will
backup the file system data of your PVCs in that namespace.
The ``Schedule`` will be executed using timezome ``Europe/Zurich``.
